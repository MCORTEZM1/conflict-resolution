# conflict-resolution

## This is a subheading created locally from the terminal 

All of this content added to the readme file has been added from my local Git repository.



## **Description**

- This is my first conflict resolution attempt on github, theres not much to see here tbh... 
- Above are some command-line inputs that I decided to leave...
- The motivation behind this was to further my undestanding of how to use github and address common issues. 
- While building this site, I began first understanding the potential headache that is merge conflict resolution. 
- This README is here to serve the purpose of having a professional ReadME for all repos.
- Again, thank you for reading this far into it, this is simply my first attempt at conflict resolution on Github.
